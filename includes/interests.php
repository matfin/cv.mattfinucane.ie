<p>
    My main interests lie in technology, the web, game development and how people interact with these. I am a self&ndash; taught iOS and Android developer and am working on a few of my own projects. My code can be seen on <a href="http://github.com/matfin" title="Matt Finucane on GitHub">GitHub</a>.

    I have also worked on several pro&ndash;bono websites and projects for individuals and organisations starting out. In 2011 I took part in the <a href="http://24theweb.com/about" title="24 The Web Design Challenge">24 The Web Design Challenge</a> and was lead developer in a team of seven people.
